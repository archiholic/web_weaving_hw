          <h4>About me: </h4>
          <p>I'm an architect under construction. I've lived a life full of love, care and support. My parents are simply peerless! My dad is my hero and my mom is my guidebook and my siblings are annoying! I love climbing mountains, canyoning, paragliding and rafting! I love to explore different things from food to languages. In my free time I try to perfect my crochet skills. I also love challenges and nothing can stop me. Coding and fabricating are my new and current interests!  Finally, I can't wait to become a sucessful, well-known architect. </p>

          <!-- how about <figure>, instead of img ? look at HTML5 flow chart-->
